                <ul>
                <li>A nationally awarded graphic designer and versatile software engineer with 10+ years experience developing high-impact websites, apps and graphics. After establishing my professional career as a graphic designer for several newspapers around the U.S. I became curious about the evolution of real-time news reporting and the increasing importance of the internet in spreading this information faster,  wider and more interactively. So I pivoted into web design after studying at NYU in New York City and found it a natural extension of my design sensibilities. Now I’m a full-stack developer who can articulate my ideas in an effective, compelling way. Whether it’s through a responsive site with front-end design and/or back-end coding, creative project direction or mobile app development my experience working with a variety of technologies has helped me excel in environments that are often fast-paced, detail-oriented and involve diverse tasks.</li>

It’s the very first line in an HTML file, short for document type. It is a declaration used in HTML5 to distinguish between a standards-compliant parsing mode and a quirks parsing mode. Hence, it’s presence tells the browser to parse and render the webpage in standards mode.</div>

                    <div class="content">ks became popular, front end developers used data- attributes to store extra data within the DOM itself, without other hacks such as non-standard attributes, extra properties on the DOM. It is intended to store custom data private to the page or application, for which there are no more appropriate attributes or elements. These days, using data- attributes is not encouraged. For one thing, users can modify the data attribute easily by using inspect element in the browser. The data model is better stored within JavaScript itself and stay updated with the DOM via data binding possibly through a library or a framework.

                      • Connectivity — Allowing you to communicate with the server in new and innovative ways.
                      • Offline and storage — Allowing webpages to store data on the client-side locally and operate offline more efficiently.
                      • Multimedia — Making video and audio first-class citizens in the Open Web.
                      • 2D/3D graphics and effects — Allowing a much more diverse range of presentation options.
                      • Performance and integration — Providing greater speed optimization and better usage of computer hardware.
                      • Device access — Allowing for the usage of various input and output devices.

                    <div class="content">All the above mentioned technologies are key-value storage mechanisms on the client side. They are only able to store values as strings.
                      Cookie:
                      Max size of 4093 bytes
                      Can set expiration date
                      Sent on every request
                      sessionStorage:
                      Max size of 2.5MBs+ depending on browser
                      Stored in browser and not sent with every request
                      If you close a tab using sessionStorage, open a new tab, or exit the browser - you’ll lose that specific sessionStorage data.
                      localStorage:
                      Max size of 2.5MBs+ depending on browser

                    <div class="content"> script - HTML parsing is blocked, the script is fetched and executed immediately, HTML parsing resumes after the script is executed.
                    script async > - The script will be fetched in parallel to HTML parsing and executed as soon as it is available (potentially before HTML parsing completes). Use async when the script is independent of any other scripts on the page, for example analytics.
                    script defer > - The script will be fetched in parallel to HTML parsing and executed when the page has finished parsing. If there are multiple of them, each deferred script is executed in the order they were encoun­tered in the document. If a script relies on a fully-parsed DOM, the defer attribute will be useful in ensuring that the HTML is fully parsed before executing. There's not much difference from putting a normal script > at the end of body >. A deferred script must not contain document.write. Note: The async and defer attrib­utes are ignored for scripts that have no src attribute.

                    <div class="content">Progressive rendering is the name given to techniques used to improve performance of a webpage (in particular, improve perceived load time) to render content for display as quickly as possible. It used to be much more prevalent in the days before broadband internet but it is still useful in modern development as mobile data connections are becoming increasingly popular (and unreliable)! Examples of such techniques:
                      Lazy loading of images — Images on the page are not loaded all at once. JavaScript will be used to load an image when the user scrolls into the part of the page that displays the image.
                      Prioritizing visible content (or above-the-fold rendering) — Include only the minimum CSS/content/scripts necessary for the amount of page that would be rendered in the users browser first to display as quickly as possible, you can then use deferred scripts or listen for the DOMContentLoaded/load event to load in other resources and content.
                      Async HTML fragments — Flushing parts of the HTML to the browser as the page is constructed on the back end.

                    <div class="content">Yes, Jade, ERB, Slim, Handlebars, Jinja, Liquid, just to name a few. In my opinion, they are more or less the same and provide similar functionality of escaping content and helpful filters for manipulating the data to be displayed. Most templating engines will also allow you to inject your own filters in the event you need custom processing before display.

                    <div class="content">Specificity is the means by which browsers decide which CSS property values are the most relevant to an element and, therefore, will be applied. Simply put, if two CSS selectors apply to the same element, the one with higher specificity is used. They are given a point value and weighted against each other by: inline-styles (1000), ID selectors (100), classes attributes and pseudo-classes (10) and finally elements and pseudo-elements (1). The property values of selectors with a higher weight will always be applied over a selector with a lower weight.

                    <div class="content">IDs — Meant to be unique within the document. Can be used to identify an element when linking using a fragment identifier. Elements can only have one id attribute.
                      Classes — Can be reused on multiple elements within the document. Mainly for styling and targeting elements.

                    <div class="content">The z-index property in CSS controls the vertical stacking order of elements that overlap. z-index only affects elements that have a position value which is not static.

                      Without any z-index value, elements stack in the order that they appear in the DOM (the lowest one down at the same hierarchy level appears on top). Elements with non-static positioning (and their children) will always appear on top of elements with default static positioning, regardless of HTML hierarchy.

                    <div class="content">CSS sprites combine multiple images into one single larger image. It is a commonly-used technique for icons. How to implement it:
                      Use a sprite generator that packs multiple images into one and generate the appropriate CSS for it.
                      Each image would have a corresponding CSS class with background-image, background-position and background-size properties defined.
                      To use that image, add the corresponding class to your element.
                      Advantages:
                      Reduce the number of HTTP requests for multiple images (only one single request is required per spritesheet). But with HTTP2, loading multiple images is no longer much of an issue.
                      Advance downloading of assets that won't be downloaded until needed, such as images that only appear upon :hover pseudo-states. Blinking wouldn't be seen.

                      position; absolute; left: -99999px. Position it outside of the screen.
                      text-indent: -9999px. This only works on text within the block elements.
                      
                      I would go with the `absolute` positioning approach, as it has the least caveats and works for most elements.

                      CSS is made more maintainable.
                      Easy to write nested selectors.
                      Variables for consistent theming. Can share theme files across different projects.
                      Mixins to generate repeated CSS.
                      Sass features like loops, lists, and maps can make configuration easier and less verbose.
                      Splitting your code into multiple files. CSS files can be split up too but doing so will require an HTTP request to download each CSS file.
                      Disadvantages:
                      Requires tools for preprocessing. Re-compilation time can be slow.
                      Not writing currently and potentially usable CSS. For example, by using something like postcss-loader with webpack, you can write potentially future-compatible CSS, allowing you to use things like CSS variables instead of Sass variables. Thus, you're learning new skills that could pay off if/when they become standardized.

                    <div class="content">The CSS box model describes the rectangular boxes that are generated for elements in the document tree and laid out according to the visual formatting model. Each box has a content area (e.g. text, an image, etc.) and optional surrounding padding, border, and margin areas.
                      The CSS box model is responsible for calculating:
                      How much space a block element takes up.
                      Whether or not borders and/or margins overlap, or collapse.
                      A box's dimensions.
                      The box model has the following rules:
                      The dimensions of a block element are calculated by width, height, padding, borders, and margins.
                      If no height is specified, a block element will be as high as the content it contains, plus padding (unless there are floats, for which see below).
                      If no width is specified, a non-floated block element will expand to fit the width of its parent minus padding.
                      The height of an element is calculated by the content's height.
                      The width of an element is calculated by the content's width.
                      By default, paddings and borders are not part of the width and height of an element.

                    <div class="content">By default, elements have box-sizing: content-box applied, and only the content size is being accounted for.
                      box-sizing: border-box changes how the width and height of elements are being calculated, border and padding are also being included in the calculation.
                      The height of an element is now calculated by the content's height + vertical padding + vertical border width.
                      The width of an element is now calculated by the content's width + horizontal padding + horizontal border width.
                      Taking into account paddings and borders as part of our box model resonates better with how designers actually imagine content in grids.

                    <div class="content">A positioned element is an element whose computed position property is either relative, absolute,

                    static - The default position; the element will flow into the page as it normally would. The top, right, bottom, left and z-index properties do not apply.
                    relative - The element's position is adjusted relative to itself, without changing layout (and thus leaving a gap for the element where it would have been had it not been positioned).
                    absolute - The element is removed from the flow of the page and positioned at a specified position relative to its closest positioned ancestor if any, or otherwise relative to the initial containing block. Absolutely positioned boxes can have margins, and they do not collapse with any other margins. These elements do not affect the position of other elements.
                    fixed - The element is removed from the flow of the page and positioned at a specified position relative to the viewport and doesn't move when scrolled.
                    sticky - Sticky positioning is a hybrid of relative and fixed positioning. The element is treated as relative positioned until it crosses a specified threshold, at which point it is treated as fixed positioned.

                      Responsive: There is one basic layout, and it changes responsively by adapting its size or other functionality according to the device’s screen size, typically the viewport width, through CSS media queries.
                      A mobile first strategy is also responsive, however it agrees we should default and define all the styles for mobile devices, and only add specific responsive rules to other devices later. It forces us to write cleaner code in respect to responsive CSS rules.

                      Responsive design works on the principle of flexibility - a single fluid website that can look good on any device. Responsive websites use media queries, flexible grids, and responsive images to create a user experience that flexes and changes based on a multitude of factors.
                      Adaptive design is more like the modern definition of progressive enhancement. Instead of one flexible design, adaptive design detects the device and other features and then provides the appropriate feature and layout based on a predefined set of viewport sizes and other characteristics. The site detects the type of device used and delivers the pre-set layout for that device.

                    <div class="content">Retina is just a marketing term to refer to high resolution screens with a pixel ratio bigger than 1. The key thing to know is that using a pixel ratio means these displays are emulating a lower resolution screen in order to show elements with the same size. Nowadays we consider all mobile devices retina defacto displays.
                      Browsers by default render DOM elements according to the device resolution, except for images.
                      In order to have crisp, good-looking graphics that make the best of retina displays we need to use high resolution images whenever possible. However using always the highest resolution images will have an impact on performance as more bytes will need to be sent over the wire.
                      To overcome this problem, we can use responsive images, as specified in HTML5.

                    <div class="label">38. Is there any reason you'd want to use translate() instead of absolute positioning, or vice-versa? And why?</div>
                    <div class="content">translate() is a value of CSS transform. Changing transform or opacity does not trigger browser reflow or repaint but does trigger compositions; whereas changing the absolute positioning triggers reflow. transform causes the browser to create a GPU layer for the element but changing absolute positioning properties uses the CPU. Hence translate() is more efficient and will result in shorter paint times for smoother animations.
                      When using translate(), the element still occupies its original space (sort of like position: relative), unlike in changing the absolute positioning.
